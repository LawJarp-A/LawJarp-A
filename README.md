# Hello, I'm **Prajwal Anagani**

**Deep Learning Engineer • Computer Vision Researcher • Applied Scientist**

I work across the full ML stack — **model design, training, large-scale data pipelines, and high-performance deployment**. My primary focus is applied deep learning and computer vision, especially building systems that operate reliably in production.

I enjoy converting state-of-the-art research into **robust, optimized systems** used in real products.
